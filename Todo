Revision history for Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-NGLENN

- Write some code
- Write some tests
- Replace boilerplate docs with real documentation

Dependent on others:
    - Figure out how to replace NGLENN bundle with real dependencies in output dependencies (authordeps, etc.); then it could be tested with Travis, which would be useful for making sure all of those dependencies are still OK.
    - Put Git::CheckFor::CorrectBranch back in when the bug in File::NFSLock is fixed
